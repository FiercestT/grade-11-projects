# Caesar Cipher
A console based Caesar cipher that I developed in my Introduction to Computer Science class in Grade 11.
## How to Use
To run the program, use Run.bat. This will load the program in a command prompt window.
Source code is in the src folder.
## Functions
- Encrypt: Encrypts a String based on a specified key ranging from 1-26 (Shifts letters by that key).
- Decrypt: Decrypt an encrypted String based on a key that must be inputted.
- Brute Force: Decrypts a key based on all possible keys. User must specify the key they wish to decrypt and its decrypted value.

All keys will be copied to clipboard at the end of a process.
