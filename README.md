# grade-11-projects
This are the first few console based assignments in the first couple months of me using Java.
Source Code, a build, as well as instructions are available in each folder.

JDK 10 or beyond is required as I used var keywords (because I brought over my C# laziness).
All these programs can be heavily optimized but they work. So you can use them to learn, or whatever you want to do with them.
Just don't be that guy that plagiarizes work without even thanking the guy who put the work into it first.

List of projects:
+ <b>Bunco:</b> Console based version of the dice game "bunco" with ansicon.
+ <b>Caesar Cipher:</b> Console based caesar cipher that shifts letters based on a number key.
+ <b>Console Hangman:</b> Console based hangman game with a topic generator that scrapes a website for words.
+ <b>Duplicate Checker:</b> A slow (single threaded), but functional project that runs a serial check on files to find duplicately named files in different directories.
+ <b>Release Files:</b> A simple Object structure that replaces certain strings in paths with a new one for different directories in release vs ide versions.
