# grade-11-projects
This are the first few console based assignments in the first couple months of me using Java.
Source Code, a build, as well as instructions are available in each folder.

JDK 10 or beyond is required as I used var keywords (because I brought over my C# laziness).
All these programs can be heavily optimized but they work. So you can use them to learn, or whatever you want to do with them.
Just don't be that guy that plagiarizes work without even thanking the guy who put the work into it first.
