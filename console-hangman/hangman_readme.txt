The hangman game must run with ansicon to display the colors properly otherwise there will be ansi codes in front of words. Read the ansicon_readme if there are any issues.

The program must have the Topics folder or the program will not work properly. If there is no folder named "Topics" in this directory (not the source code). Create one. 

Within the program, you can run the utility to add topics by isolating html code from a wordlist website. These words are added to the hangman word and topic rotation. You require an internet connection to do so and will be notified if there is a problem when running the utility. You may only use a subcategory from the site provided when running the utility

You may edit the files within the topics folder to add or remove words and even add custom topics that will work within the game. 

If you add files or words: Make sure there are no whitespaces or empty lines when doing so.
